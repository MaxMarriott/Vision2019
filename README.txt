EYYYYY:

Cheers for checking this cool program out, This is a very simple scratch program
to test out camera settings on Team Koalafied 6996's robot. The purpose of this program
is to simply control the cameras of the robot and perhaps some code pertaining to
autonomous.

In an ideal world this program would work within a single CPP file, however I am still trying to
figure out how I can do that without destroying the program as it is...

AT THE MOMENT THIS PROGRAM IS BROKEN SO DON'T BOTHER TRYING TO RUN IT!
